🔥 LEVEL 1 — ABSOLUTE MUST KNOW (If you don’t know these, you fail)

1. SQL Joins — INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL

Explain them, write examples, and know when each is used.

---

2. GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY

Most candidates confuse HAVING vs WHERE — don’t be one of them.

3. WHERE vs. ON vs. HAVING

Interviewers love tricking candidates here.

⸻

4. Subqueries + Common Table Expressions (CTE)

You will definitely be asked CTE.

5. Indexes (Clustered vs Nonclustered)

You must know:
	•	What a clustered index is
	•	What a nonclustered index is
	•	When NOT to add an index
	•	Why indexes slow INSERT/UPDATE

Interviewers always ask:

👉 “If performance drops in a table with millions of rows, what would you check first?”
Correct answer → indexes + execution plan + missing index hint.

6. Execution Plans

You don’t need to be an expert, just know:
	•	what a scan is
	•	what a seek is
	•	why seeks are faster
	•	how execution plan shows missing indexes
7. Transactions & Isolation Levels

Just basics:
	•	READ COMMITTED
	•	READ UNCOMMITTED
	•	REPEATABLE READ
	•	SERIALIZABLE

And why dirty reads happen.

⸻

8. Stored Procedures

Basic CRUD stored procedures with parameters.

⸻

9. Views

What they are + when to use them.

⸻

10. SQL functions

Difference between:
	•	Scalar
	•	Table-valued
	•	Built-in functions (LEN, GETDATE, etc.)

⸻

11. Constraints
	•	PRIMARY KEY
	•	FOREIGN KEY
	•	UNIQUE
	•	CHECK
	•	DEFAULT

⸻

12. Null handling

Know:
	•	ISNULL
	•	COALESCE
	•	NULL behavior in joins

🔥 LEVEL 2 — EXPECTED FOR INTERMEDIATE DEVELOPER (.NET)

13. Pagination (OFFSET / FETCH)

14. Temporary Tables vs Table Variables

Know differences in:
	•	performance
	•	transaction behavior
	•	indexing

⸻

15. Window functions

Very important.
	•	ROW_NUMBER
	•	RANK
	•	DENSE_RANK
	•	OVER()

⸻

16. Deadlocks + How to avoid

Your knowledge from reservation system helps.

⸻

17. SQL Injection

And how parameterized queries prevent it.

⸻

18. ACID Properties

Very common interview question.

⸻

19. Difference between DELETE vs TRUNCATE vs DROP

⸻

20. Normalization Basics

Just know:
	•	1NF
	•	2NF
	•	3NF
	•	Why normalization helps

    🟦 LEVEL 3 — BONUS (Nice to have, not mandatory)

These will make you look senior, but not required for intermediate:
	•	Partitioning
	•	Index fragmentation & REBUILD vs REORGANIZE
	•	In-memory tables
	•	Query store
	•	CROSS APPLY
	•	Dynamic SQL
