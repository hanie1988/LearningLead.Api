### Correlation ID

**How to find all the logs related to one request?**

I implemented correlation-ID-based structured logging for tracing requests

Companies here EXPECT developers to know:
	•	how to design global error handling
	•	logging architecture
	•	structured logging
	•	correlation IDs
	•	domain exceptions
	•	monitoring
	•	log pipelines
