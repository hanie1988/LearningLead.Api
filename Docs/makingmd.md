the Markdown renderer can change spacing/line-art, so the tree didn’t look exactly like the formatted version in your screenshot.
I updated the MD to match the tree style more closely by:
Using a dedicated text code block (```text) so it keeps monospace + alignment
Using consistent box-drawing characters (├──, │, └──) and indentation
Now the “Visually, the expression becomes:” section should look almost identical.
If you want it 100% identical to your screenshot (same exact characters and spacing), tell me which style you prefer:
the box-drawing style (├── │ └──)
the ASCII style (|__ etc.)
